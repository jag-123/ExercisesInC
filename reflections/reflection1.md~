# Reflection 1
My goals for this sprint were to come up with an interesting project idea and do research to figure out everything we needed to do to implement it in C. I think we successfully completed the research portion of our project, but we were lacking the C skills to make a lot of progress on the project itself. Since then, we have been focusing a lot more on the readings and exercises. 

In order to stay on task with the project we decided to have daily stand-up meetings to check in with each other about the progress we make each day. I believe that these stand-up meetings will help us tremendously throughout the next sprint in which we hope to code a large portion of our project. 

One thing that we could have done better this sprint was the exercises to head first C and thinkOS. We completed the readings before the Sprint 1 review, but we only briefly looked at the exercises. Since then, we have made it a priority to complete both the reading and exercises before the class in which they are discussed.

## ThinkOS Questions
I completed the first two chapters of thinkOS this sprint.

## Exam Question and Solution
If you were to type in "ps" in a UNIX terminal what would you see? What about if you added the "-e" flag to "ps"? What could you infer about a process name "kblockd"?

Answer: 
You would see information about the list of processes running. The "-e" flag shows every process, including processes belonging to other users. I can infer from "kblockd" that it is a kernel which means it is part of the os that is responsible for core capabilites. Also, I could infer that it is a daemon process which means that it is a process that runs in the background and provides os services.
