In the first few days of team formation, we discussed our personal learning goals and ended up with the following team goals: Our project would involve some type of physical simulation and as a team, we would get some experience with OpenCL/CUDA/OpenGL during the project and further develop our C programming knowledge. As a stretch goal, we would include distributed networks in our project. Next, we randomly picked someone to be a scrum master, which ended up being Max Schommer and we divided up the remaining tasks using Trello. Additionally, we deicided to only include tasks we had for our project in our sprint backlog on Trello. As a whole, I am excited about our upcoming project, but I am still apprehensive that we will choose a project that is not overscoped/reasonable to complete in the allotted time.
